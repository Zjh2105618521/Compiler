# Compiler Frontend

A simple C-like compiler front-end, which can compile the source program into three address intermediate code.

The project is implemented with C++ language, including lexical scanner, LR syntax parser, semantic analysis and intermediate code generation.
* Lexical Scanner: include character input processing, token recognition, symbol table processing, error processing and token output functions.
* LR Syntax Parser: use custom grammar, include state generation processing, analysis table construction, analysis stack processing, error processing and general control program.
* Semantic Analysis and Intermediate Code Generation: achieve grammar guided translation.
